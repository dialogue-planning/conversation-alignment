        """The main beam search algorithm.

        NOTE: We assume that the provided conversation begins with an action,
        due to the fact that in dialogue-as-planning, agents use actions and
        users respond to those actions with one of a set of given intents.

        Beam search is executed on all the conversations provided.
        A JSON with statistics that indicates which conversations failed/passed
        is returned.

        NOTE ABOUT THE HANDLING OF ACTION TYPES:
            There are currently limitations on the types of actions the
            algorithm can handle. While the algorithm can handle all dialogue actions,
            system and api actions pose a problem as they do not directly rely on user
            input to execute. This leds to ambiguity in terms of which action to
            execute if multiple system or api actions are applicable in a given state
            and there may not be enough beams to cover all possibilities.

            It is likely possible to extend the algorithm to handle these cases. In the
            meantime, though, we implemented a workaround to at least handle some system
            actions so that the possibility for agent complexity is maintained. The
            rules are as follows:
            - A system/api action will only be executed if it is the only applicable action
              in the state. The process is iterated until we are no longer in that state
              (i.e. have some dialogue/message action to execute).
            - When a system/api action is executed, we just take the highest-confidence outcome
              (pretty much always 1.0) and use that to extend the relevant beam. Since
              these actions are meant to perform some logic, the results are typically binary
              and/or only one applies in the current state (i.e. we can't "explore" the
              other return results of an api call by giving it the same input, or explore
              the other outcomes in the context-dependent outcome determiner). so, we don't
              restructure the beams here, only append to the existing ones.
            - System/api actions, where there exist applicable dialogue action(s), are
              ignored for the rest of the iteration. This is because system/api actions have
              no messages to compare against.
            - If the algorithm comes across a case where you have multiple applicable
              system/api actions and no dialogue or message actions, an error is raised.
              This is because it is ambiguous which system/api action to execute.
            - The algorithm will time out if it spends too long running system actions. (This
              can especially happen if a system action does not "deactivate" itself and thus
              runs forever).

            We also make the assumption that a system action that executes automatically
            has a confidence of 1.0 (since it is not being compared against any messages).
            However, the outcomes have their own confidences returned by the outcome
            determiner.

            Finally, we note the difference between system/api actions and message actions.
            Although message actions are handled in a similar fashion in that we update the
            state and applicable actions through the singular deterministic outcome, message
            actions still "absorb" a dialogue from the input conversation while system/api
            actions do not. So, message actions update the state AFTER being compared against
            an utterance whereas the case for system/api actions needs to be checked BEFORE
            continuing the iteration.
