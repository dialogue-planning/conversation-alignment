interesting, this time we get some FN! 

clarify__cuisine still a drop-off node, this time the only one. don't know why though so let's look at where it is failing.
in this case the only conversation! convo_20

but there is no "clarify" in this conversation anyway!

if we trace back up the beam where the fallback happens, we can see where we hit our first "clarify."

we seem to pick it because the other path tries to pick single_slot__outing_type when in fact we should already have the outing type! which means that there is a problem with slot-fill__get_outing.
looking at the model this is indeed true! (when we try to only extract outing type)
