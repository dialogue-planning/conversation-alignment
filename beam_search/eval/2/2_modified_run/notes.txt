PROCEDURE:
We allow for fixing up to 4 fluents each time to speed things up.
You can fix a fluent if it is indicated by an error, or if it is in an action indicated by an error.
Obviously you have a deep knowledge of the agent and know what to fix... so to my understandng, we are mostly showing here
that the agent is showing us WHERE to fix things and that these are helpful metrics when debugging,
as opposed to blindly looking at the model.

time to look at convo_3 again!

difficult to see what's going on...

we pick another random convo, convo_1.

convo_1 ok now!

the other failing beams don't seem to be failing because of something broken--
it looks like the "correct" beam is just slightly getting won out by a different beam, which ultimately fails.
this would also explain why we have fn and not tn.
we probably just need more beams!
let's up the beam count to 4 and see what happens.

that helped! convo_3 is now passing.

we have a couple fp-- let's see if we can weed them out.

first looking at convo_17.
yep, looks like it's reaching the goal through the "wrong" beam.

what is "different" about this conversation could be that we hit the dessert restriction.
indeed, it looks like this outcome is missing (conflict). the last outcome is also missing (not (conflict)). so:
this also makes sense looking at the graph since we SHOULD be resetting the preferences here, but we skipped over that since we didn't indicate the conflict.

convo_17 now failing.

asks about cuisine instead of allergy restrictions?

we aren't resetting the allergy knowledge...

back to being fp... maybe need to add more restrictions?

Can't seem to find the mysterious fp. But that's ok, a bit of noise is expected! Let's leave it here.
