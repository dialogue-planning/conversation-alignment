better results, still no drop-offs!

look at convo_17 again.

we almost make it, but get-have-allergy runs at the end! why is it applicable there?
ah, we need to update the knowledge in the deny outcome to indicate that we know that if the user has an allergy now!

add (know__have_allergy) to the "no allergy" outcome!
