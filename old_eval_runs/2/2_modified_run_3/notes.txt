----------------
iter 1:
we pick convo_14 to start with (any will do but we go with (one of the) simplest ones to weed out obvious errors)

we get pretty far but fail at the dialogue_statement after share_location.

in
dialogue_statement
dialogue_statement_DETDUP_dialogue_statement__reset-EQ-lock

add
(not (force-statement))

-----------------
iter 2:
share_cuisine needs to trigger a dialogue_statement, not get-have-allergy.

in
slot-fill__get-cuisine
slot-fill__get-cuisine_DETDUP_slot-fill__get-cuisine__validate-slot-fill-EQ-cuisine_found

add
(force-statement)

------------------
iter 3:
the first beam is getting far, but slot-fill__get-phone_number is applicable at the end where it shouldn't be.

in 
slot-fill__get-phone_number
slot-fill__get-phone_number_DETDUP_slot-fill__get-phone_number__validate-slot-fill-EQ-phone_number_found

add
(know__phone_number)

------------------
iter 4:
same problem, but with get-have-allergy!

in 
get-have-allergy
get-have-allergy_DETDUP_get-have-allergy__set-allergy-EQ-indicate_no_allergy

add
(know__have_allergy)

------------------
iter 5:
graph for convo_14 indicates error with set-outing looping!

in 
set-outing

add 
(know__outing)

------------------
iter 6:

same problem but with set-restaurant!

in
set-restaurant
set-restaurant_DETDUP_set-restaurant__assign_restaurant-EQ-set-mexican

add
(know__restaurant)

repeat for all outcomes!

------------------
iter 7:

getting an error on system action inform - not completing itself!

in 
inform
inform_DETDUP_inform__finish-EQ-finish

add
(informed)

------------------
iter 8:

same problem but with the system action complete!

in
complete
complete_DETDUP_complete__finish-EQ-finish

add
(goal)

------------------
iter 9:

convo 14 now fixed!

let's go to another failing one: convo 5.

get-allergy loops on itself. update outcome is missing nodes!

in 
get-allergy
get-allergy_DETDUP_get-allergy__set-allergy-EQ-update_allergy

add 
(know__food_restriction)

------------------
iter 10:

now in convo 5. no applicable actions after sharing allergies! supposed to be getting outing type.

ah, we have to turn off the forcing for that action.

in 
get-allergy
get-allergy_DETDUP_get-allergy__set-allergy-EQ-update_allergy

add 
(not (forcing__get-allergy))

------------------
iter 11:

share_budget not followed by a dialogue_statement! and... it's also empty!

in
single_slot__budget
single_slot__budget_DETDUP_single_slot__budget__validate-slot-fill-EQ-fill-slot

add
(force-statement)

------------------
iter 12:

we get far, but slot-fill__get_outing manages to run again. why is it still applicable?
we did not update our knowledge of the budget in single_slot__budget!

in
single_slot__budget
single_slot__budget_DETDUP_single_slot__budget__validate-slot-fill-EQ-fill-slot

add
(know__budget)

------------------
iter 13:

check-conflicts seems to get stuck this time. supposed to call set-outing next
