Ok, some interesting results now!

We will have to look at a different conversation since convo_1 is FP now and there are still some TN conversations which take priority.
We look at convo_20 instead.

share_budget from single_slot__budget is missing a trigger to get dialogue_statement to run! Looking at it now, it is also missing a knowledge update for the budget.

In:
single_slot__budget
single_slot__budget_DETDUP_single_slot__budget__validate-slot-fill-EQ-fill-slot

Add:
(force-statement)
(know__budget)
