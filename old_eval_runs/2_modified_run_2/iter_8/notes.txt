looking at our best beam again, single_slot__outing_type is executed again (and almost initiates a loop) when we should be proceeding with the conversation.

looking at the model, it is because the outcome that learns the outing type does not update the model with that knowledge.

In:
single_slot__outing_type
single_slot__outing_type_DETDUP_single_slot__outing_type__validate-slot-fill-EQ-fill-slot

Add:
(know__outing_type)
